# React + TypeScript + Vite

### Axios

### React-icon

### Styled Component

### Openmeteo

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: "latest",
    sourceType: "module",
    project: ["./tsconfig.json", "./tsconfig.node.json"],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
};
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a weather app website involves identifying the core features that meet the primary needs of your target users, ensuring the app delivers value while remaining lean and manageable for initial launch. Here's a structured approach to defining the MVP features:

# MVP File For Weather App

### 1. User Identification and Market Research

- **Define Target Audience:** Understand who your users are (e.g., general public, outdoor enthusiasts, farmers, maritime users).
- **Competitive Analysis:** Review existing weather apps to identify standard features and potential gaps to fill.

### 2. Core Features for MVP

Based on general user expectations for a weather app, consider including these core features:

- **Current Weather Conditions:** Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure for the user's current location or selected locations.
- **Hourly and Daily Forecasts:** Provide short-term (next 24 hours) and long-term (7-10 days) weather forecasts including temperature highs and lows, precipitation chances, and weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
- **Weather Maps and Radar:** Offer a visual representation of weather patterns, including precipitation and cloud cover, possibly with animation showing movement over time.
- **Weather Alerts and Warnings:** Integrate real-time alerts for severe weather conditions like storms, high winds, or flood warnings, sourced from reliable meteorological services.
- **Search and Save Locations:** Allow users to search for and save multiple locations for quick weather checks.

### 3. User Experience and Design

- **Simple and Intuitive Interface:** Ensure the app is easy to navigate, with a clear layout displaying the most critical weather information upfront.
- **Responsive Design:** Design the website to be mobile-friendly, ensuring it adjusts seamlessly across devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops).
- **Customization:** Allow users to customize settings, such as temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit), wind speed units, and theme (light or dark mode).

### 4. Technical Considerations

- **Data Source:** I use AccuWeather for now
- **Performance and Scalability:** Optimize for fast loading times and ensure the infrastructure can scale with user growth.
- **Location Services:** Integrate geolocation to automatically display weather data for the user's current location.

### 5. Legal and Compliance

- **Privacy Policy and Terms of Use:** Clearly outline how user data is used and stored, especially for location-based services.
- **Data Attribution:** Ensure compliance with the terms of service for your weather data provider, including proper attribution if required.

### 6. Testing and Feedback

- **Beta Testing:** Before full launch, conduct beta testing with a small group of users to gather feedback and identify any bugs or usability issues.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Include a way for users to report issues or provide suggestions for improvements.

### 7. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Once the MVP is stable and receiving user traction, consider adding features like:

- **Personalization:** Learning user preferences for weather information display.
- **Social Sharing:** Options to share weather conditions and alerts on social media.
- **Weather-related News:** Adding a section for news articles related to significant weather events.

Focusing on these MVP features will help you launch a functional, user-friendly weather app website that addresses the fundamental needs of your target audience while leaving room for expansion based on user feedback and technological advancements.
